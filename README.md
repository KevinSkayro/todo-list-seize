# todo-list-seize

I learned a lot of things along the process. The simple fact that I did all this by myself with the knowledge that I acquired in the past forced me to think a lot.

I solved new challenges in this project and I ended up with many questions with answers and many other questions that I'm still looking for an answer to.

One of those questions Is how to iterate over **JavaScript Generated Elements**, this has been by far the most difficult task to solve, but I'm sure I'll find a way to do this.

But if you know something about this, I'll be greatful if you could share your knowledge.
